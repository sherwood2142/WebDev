                            <p class="mainText">In June 2006, an illustrated edition of Darkholme bondage, Male Bondage, by Bruno Gm√ºnder, was published.<br>

                                In the 2010s, Wang becomes the subject of various "Gachimuchi" Internet memes. A significant part of the memes with him were made on the Japanese video hosting NicoNico, in which he is mentioned under the nickname "VAN-sama" and "TDN Kosugi". Wang reacted positively to such memes.<br><br>
                                In 2017, he starred in the visual novel Deep Dark Fantasies.<br><br>
                                Since 2020, Wang has been streaming regularly on Twitch.
